filter -> parser -> data -> (imported by) train

filter.cpp
    - filter games that do not have computer evaluations
    - filter useless headers

parser.py
    - convert each position to FEN, extract evaluations and header values

data.py
    - converts output from parser.py into a PyTorch dataset

try/todo
    - filter out low time control games, though probably after there is a baseline model in place
    - attackers plane?
    - history planes
    - tags prediction (scrape CT)
    - try different weight decay values (though cy uses same)
    - try LR warmup
    - larger parse chunks (500k~?)
    - shuffle train file order
    - determine cause for gradient norm increase in runs 5 and 6
    - try training with only the head
    - shuffle all positions in file (!)
        - would make files larger due to header duplication
    - disable weight decay
    - increase test and train size
    - load whole dataset into gpu memory
    - instead of parsing chunks of data at once, convert fens only when they need to be used (in the __getitem__)
    - castling planes
    - add random positions by same player to input, including the eval and shift (think more about player specific predictions)
    - update tester.py to interface with SF for input
    - test effect of SF depth on prediction error (hopefully it isn't too dependent on depth=20 and instead decreases with depth)
    - try L2 with adam
    - move todo list to notion
    - make train.py work with colab

tried/done
    - try adam
        - found to be much more stable than SGD so it has been in use from run8 onwards
    - add current eval to input
        - used for run10 and shows promising results
    - either rename data files or add month information to path
    - turn on bias in convs or try BN with \gamma and \beta again
    - drop or carry over small chunks (happens at end of file if there aren't enough)
        - currently it drops chunks that are smaller than 100000, but it would be more elegant to just carry them over
